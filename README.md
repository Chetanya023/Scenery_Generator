Village Scenery Simulation:

Overview:

• Implemented a simple village scenery simulation using C++ and OpenGL.

• The simulation depicts different times of the day, including morning, noon, evening, and night, with corresponding changes in the environment.

Dynamic Time Transitions:

• The simulation dynamically transitions between different times of the day, showcasing changes in the sky color, sun/moon appearance, and overall atmosphere.

Interactive User Interface:

• Users can select the desired time of the day by entering the corresponding option (1 for morning, 2 for noon, 3 for evening, 4 for night).

• The simulation provides a visually engaging representation of a village with huts, mountains, river, and stars.

Random Hut Placement:

• Huts are randomly placed in the village, avoiding overlaps and ensuring a scenic distribution.

• Huts are scattered across the landscape, creating a diverse and visually appealing village layout.

Customizable and Extensible:

• Users can easily extend or customize the simulation by modifying parameters like hut count, sizes, and placement logic.

• The code is well-documented, making it accessible for users to understand and modify as per their preferences.
